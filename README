* Version:
1.3

* Depends:
jQuery framework: http://www.jquery.com

* Description:
Multi selection on the select tag without holding the <ctrl> button; the plugin doesn't add any additional HTML.

* How to build it:
The source file are in src/: the file multiselect-min.js is the only file you need to include in your pages.
Edit the sources in src/ and run the Makefile (by make) to get the minimized source.
In the dependencies folder there is the jQuery framework, version 1.7.2: this is the version i used in my tests.

* TODO:
- The dependencies are wrong: jQuery ui is not needed, just jQuery!
- Improve comments (by JSDoc to generate autodocumentation)
- Add tests
- Add sort options module
- Add Gruntfile


I wrote it in my current company, WCN (wcn.co.uk), and i was allowed to release it as open source. Thank you (particularly to Jack Hobson)!
