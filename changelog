1.3: Added flag "allowSubmit" (false as default)
     TO BE TESTED
     because the selection on the multiselect is a fake, the multiselect
		 wasn't correctly submitted with the form.
		 It should work but, because it is to be tested, as default is disabled

1.2: Made the plugin modular; delete the folder src-dev-modules-alpha because 
     it was redundant (it purpose was to provide a modular Multiselect).
		 Merged folder src-dev and src-min in the folder src.

1.1: Added categories selection features
     Cleaned the repo history on GitHub
